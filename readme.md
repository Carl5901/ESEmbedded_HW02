HW02
===
This is the hw02 sample. Please follow the steps below.

# Build the Sample Program

1. Fork this repo to your own github account.

2. Clone the repo that you just forked.

3. Under the hw02 dir, use:

	* `make` to build.

	* `make clean` to clean the ouput files.

4. Extract `gnu-mcu-eclipse-qemu.zip` into hw02 dir. Under the path of hw02, start emulation with `make qemu`.

	See [Lecture 02 ─ Emulation with QEMU] for more details.

5. The sample is designed to help you to distinguish the main difference between the `b` and the `bl` instructions.  

	See [ESEmbedded_HW02_Example] for knowing how to do the observation and how to use markdown for taking notes.

# Build Your Own Program

1. Edit main.s.

2. Make and run like the steps above.

# HW02 Requirements

1. Please modify main.s to observe the `push` and the `pop` instructions:  

	Does the order of the registers in the `push` and the `pop` instructions affect the excution results?  

	For example, will `push {r0, r1, r2}` and `push {r2, r0, r1}` act in the same way?  

	Which register will be pushed into the stack first?

2. You have to state how you designed the observation (code), and how you performed it.  

	Just like how [ESEmbedded_HW02_Example] did.

3. If there are any official data that define the rules, you can also use them as references.

4. Push your repo to your github. (Use .gitignore to exclude the output files like object files or executable files and the qemu bin folder)

push {r0,r1,r2}的意思為依序將r2,r1,r0的資料放入堆疊中如此一來最底層的資料為r2最上層為r0
編譯器無法編譯push {r2,r0,r1}原因為大括弧內的的記憶體編號必須為遞增，因此將指令變更為push{r1},push{r0},push{r1}代替，結果變為最底的資料為r1,最頂的資料為r2。
